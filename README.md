Executable Commitment Theory (ECT) treats strategies not as mere intentions but as executable, verifiable policies. Each player deploys a policy (code/contract/mechanism) whose certified properties—like “auto-retaliate within ≤1ms,” spending caps, or safety constraints—are publicly attestable via a verifier, optionally in zero-knowledge. Payoffs combine environmental utility with compute and latency costs, so stronger guarantees have real resource trade-offs. Rational deviations are restricted to admissible (provably certifiable) policies, yielding a Proof-Commitment Equilibrium (PCE) where credibility is endogenous and strategic power depends on what you can prove, how fast you can prove it, and what you choose to disclose. ECT reshapes equilibrium selection (e.g., deterrence via certified retaliation), and applies naturally to markets with bot policies, security protocols, and multi-agent RL that learns over policies + proofs.
